# SECURED

Welcome to the "SECURED" project, an elementary programming challenge in C that focuses on introducing the concept of hash tables. This project is designed to test and expand your understanding of C programming, specifically in the areas of hash functions and data security. As part of your journey at Epitech, this project aims to secure your most precious creationsâ€”your robot blueprints for the upcoming robot battle tournament.

## Project Overview

In a world where technology reigns supreme, protecting your intellectual property becomes paramount. "SECURED" challenges you to construct a digital safe, a hash table, to safeguard your robot plans. Your mission involves mastering the art of hashing, turning your plans into encrypted enigmas accessible only to those with the correct key.

### Objectives

- Develop your own hash function.
- Create your own hash table capable of handling a large number of entries.

### Skills

This project builds on previously acquired skills, adding several new ones to your repertoire:

- Merging arrays and linked lists.
- Function pointers.
- Library compilation.
- Understanding and implementation of hash algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C programming knowledge.
- Familiarity with command-line tools and Makefile.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the library using the `make` command.

## Implementation

The project involves the following key components:

### Hash Function

Develop a hash function that meets the following criteria:

- Deterministic output based on input.
- Utilization of all input data.
- Significant output variance for similar inputs.
- Even data distribution across the hash table.

### Hash Table

Implement a hash table with the following functionalities:

- `new_hashtable`: Create a new hash table.
- `delete_hashtable`: Safely delete a hash table.
- `ht_insert`: Insert a new element into the hash table.
- `ht_delete`: Remove an element from the hash table.
- `ht_search`: Search for an element in the hash table.
- `ht_dump`: Display the current state of the hash table.

## Handling Collisions

Implement separate chaining to resolve hash collisions, allowing multiple elements to be stored at the same index.

## Usage

Here is a simple example demonstrating the creation of a hash table and the insertion of elements:

```c
int main(void) {
    hashtable_t *ht = new_hashtable(&hash, 4);
    ht_insert(ht, "Key1", "Value1");
    ht_insert(ht, "Key2", "Value2");
    ht_dump(ht);
    return 0;
}
```
